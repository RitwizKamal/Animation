# Animation
Creating a scenario where an object, say butterfly flies around another object, say flower 
along a circular path. Consider two more objects, a robot and a horse, which are initially 
widely apart from the flower. If either the horse or the robot wants to move closer to the 
flower by covering 50% of the initial distance, the butterfly flies through straight-line 
and starts moving around an elliptical path. When both the horse and the robot move towards
their initial position covering by more than 50% of their initial distance from the flower,
the butterfly comes down and starts flying around the flower as before. Arrow buttons are used
corresponding to the movement control of the horse and the robot. For each object, ensured 
movements of their body parts (like movement of legs) to create the scenario as real as possible.
